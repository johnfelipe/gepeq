<!--
Sample navigator.xml. Please copy to navigator.xml then modify according to your
needs. The comments in here should explain most options.

This file is read when the web application starts. Consequently any changes do
not take effect without a webapp reload.

Note that navigator.xml is not stored in the WEB-INF folder; this is for
logistical reasons in our setup (basically, each server needs a different
navigator.xml, but they all have the same WEB-INF folder which we replace
when updating version). However OpenMark is configured so that it won't serve
requests for this file, so your database password should be safe.
